# CFG-Assignments
## `Hello World`! Welcome to my readme! 👋

My name is Bee, and I'm on the *Data Science* pathway of the Autumn 2024 CFGdegree. I'm being sponsored by [DSTL](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/defence-science-and-technology-laboratory).

- I have previously completed a number of different CFG coding courses, as well as making the most of external learning opportunities:

I am planning to use this repository to submit my various assignments, this profile as a whole may also be used as a resource for new information I learn along my coding journey. 

<h3>Assignment 1</h3>

I have created:
- [X] [.gitignore](/.gitignore)
- [X] [requirements.txt](/requirements.txt)  
files within my main repository. </br>
.gitignore files are important because they hide certain files from `git status` and means that these files are not selected using commands like `git add`. Depending on what the repository is being used for, there may be a large amount of data and code for different libraries used in the files but which you wouldn't want to download each time, as it will bloat the downloads.</br>
In this case I have chosen a standard .gitignore file for python, but the .gitignore file is not mandatory when creating a repo - just a good idea!
