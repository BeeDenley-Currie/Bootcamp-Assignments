# CFG-Assignments
## `Hello World`! Welcome to my readme! 👋

My name is Bee, and I'm on the *Data Science* pathway of the Autumn 2024 CFGdegree. I'm being sponsored by [DSTL](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/defence-science-and-technology-laboratory).

- I have previously completed a number of different CFG coding courses, as well as making the most of external learning opportunities

I am planning to use this repository to submit my various assignments, this profile as a whole may also be used as a resource for new information I learn along my coding journey. 

<h3>Assignment 1</h3>

1. I created this repository on Github, and then cloned it to my local repository.  
2. With this, I have checked the status, and created the "new-branch" branch. This is where I added the empty requirements.txt file, and then committed this change while explaining the addition. Both branches were then pushed to the remote repository

3. On Github I created a pull request,

4. I then merged that pull request.

5. And finally I have used `git pull` to keep my local repository up to date.

> The [requirements.txt](/requirements.txt) file is a list of the necessary libraries/packages and their version numbers to be installed for the code in the repository to work. These are not included in the project folder itself, but instead the file is a list that can then be downloaded in your IDE, using a command like `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Requirements.txt makes it easy for others to use your project, as they can easily install required packages.
> The version numbers are important because some features may not be available in all versions of a package, which could cause your code not to work.

Within this repository I have also created a :
- [X] [.gitignore](/.gitignore) file
> .gitignore files are important because they hide certain files from `git status` and means that these files are not selected using commands like `git add`. Depending on what the repository is being used for, there may be a large amount of data and code for different libraries used in the files but which you wouldn't want to download each time, as it will bloat the downloads. It can be set to ignore personal information, for example if there's a file with login details.</br>
In this case I have chosen a standard .gitignore file for python, but the .gitignore file is not mandatory when creating a repo - just a good idea!
