# CFG-Assignments
<h2>Hello There! Welcome to my readme! 👋 </h2>

My name is Bee, and I'm on the *Data Science* pathway of the Autumn 2024 CFGdegree. I'm being sponsored by [DSTL](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/defence-science-and-technology-laboratory).

I have previously completed a number of different CFG coding courses, as well as making the most of external learning opportunities:
- March - April 2024: “Intro to Data & SQL” 8-week Kickstarter with Code First Girls, using MySQL and Tableau - **Highly Commended Candidate, solo Project winner** (created Environmental Records database for final project)
- January 2024: “Learn to code for data analysis” short course with The Open University, using Python
- October - December 2023: “Intro to Python & Apps” 8-week Kickstarter with Code First Girls - <b>Highly Commended Candidate, Group Project winner</b> ([repository](https://github.com/BeeD-C/pick-a-choose))
- October 2023: “Intro to Python” 4-week MOOC with Code First Girls
- February 2023: “Bacterial Genomes I: From DNA to Protein Function Using Bioinformatics” short course with Wellcome Connecting Science
- Ongoing: “Pathogen Genomics: A New Era in Global Health Surveillance and Strategy” short course with Wellcome Connecting Science

I am planning to use this repository to submit my various assignments, this profile as a whole may also be used as a resource for new information I learn along my coding journey. 

<h3>Assignment 1</h3>
I have created both a [.gitignore](/.gitignore) and a [requirements.txt](/requirements.txt) file within my main repository.
